<p align="center">	Here at Aronson-Campbell Industrial Supply, selling world-class-quality cutting tools is an important part of what we do.

But it’s not all we do.

Today’s ever-changing arena of high-speed, CNC manufacturing makes it no easy undertaking to stay competitive. Manufacturers need to make their spindles as efficient as possible, which means that off-the-shelf cutters won’t always be their first choice. To hit a special profile in the bottom of a hole, all too often the exact right neck on an end mill or angle tangent to a radius on a bore just can’t be achieved with any old stock tool.

Enter Aronson-Campbell Custom Grinding, located in Spokane, Washington. Our talented tool and cutter grinders are well versed in both the modification of new tools and (if and when it makes sense) the fabrication of completely custom cutters, ground from solid blanks. Our team has a combined half century of experience in tool and cutter grinding. We rely on that experience daily for the precise, accurate manufacturing of our customer’s cutting tools.</p>

With manufacturing costs constantly rising, it only makes sense to protect your investments. It’s time to pull that dulling tool out of the spindle before catastrophic failure and let our guys put a factory-like fresh regrind on it. That way, it can get right back into production and making you a profit.

As our account managers always tell our customers, “If it needs a grind, keep Aronson-Campbell in mind.”<br><br>
